# CS225-Final-project

### The final project in UIUC Fall 2022

## Leading Question 
   
   Our group decide to the porject "Open flight" Our goul is to find any shortest ath algorithm to find preferred routes and make a graphical output on projected onto a world map. To find the weight for the graph, we use the airport data to compute the distance and use that as the weight. It is very useful and applicable. Finding the shortest path algorithms of routes and make the output graphically can help people find the shortest and preferred routes. Working on the datasets of the open flights can help us better understand connectivity and human geography. Throughout this final project, we will use BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, etc to resolve the problems.
   
   
## Document

Our team contract, team proposal and FP_Log can be find 

## Dataset Acquisition

We use data of airport and route:


https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/airports.dat
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/routes.dat

which can be find in /data directory.


## Timeline

design write openflight algorithms(due: 11.13)

write code completely(due: 11.27)

Write descriptive README and final report(due: 12.4)

Project close-out, inspection and final presentation(due: 12.8)
